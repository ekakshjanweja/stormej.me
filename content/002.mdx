# What is Team Black Box?

Hello there! [Team Black Box](https://teamblackbox.in/) was created to build unique products (software and hardware), open-source code, and content. We call it "Building the Amaze".

## TL;DR

It sounds like the internship interview process at Team Black Box involves several stages, including an initial application, a video interview, and the completion of a project. The application form asks about the applicant's background, recent projects, learning habits, and areas of interest. The video interviews focus on the applicant's technical skills and also delve into their personal interests. As part of the process, applicants are also required to build a react native app and a react js web app in a short period of time. The final video interview allows for further discussion and reflection on the experience. Overall, the process appears to be designed to assess the applicant's technical skills, creativity, and overall personality.

# How did I discover Team Black Box?

I recently learned about Team Black Box through a Linkedin post and applied for their 2023 batch 1 internship program, which is a six-month internship. I was pleased to discover that the application form focused on my overall personality rather than my technical skills, which I found to be a unique approach. I also read about their interview process and found it extremely amazing.

## Application

I applied for the internship by filling out a Google form on their website. The form asked me about my background, my recent projects, how I learn new things, and what excites me. I thought it was a clever way to get to know me beyond just my technical skills.

## Video Interview 1

In about 10 days, they scheduled a video interview with me. [Subbu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/subramanian-elavathur/) and [Aditya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-shetty-318b09b6/) were my interviewers, and both were fantastic people - they kept the conversation engaging and interesting. During the interview, they asked me about my background and my thoughts on different tech stacks, particularly flutter and react native. They also asked me about my interests outside of technology, like food, travel, and video games. Overall, it felt more like a friendly conversation than a typical interview.

## Build a simple app and or a website

The next step in the process was to build a react native app and a react js web app in just two weeks. I had never worked with javascript or typescript before, let alone react native or react js, so I had to learn on the fly and build the apps as I went. I shared regular updates on my progress, including my learning and project development. They were looking for consistency and creativity, and I tried to demonstrate both in my work. It was a challenging but exciting experience.

## Guidelines

1.&nbsp;Share a GitHub repository for the code\
2.&nbsp;Give regular updates

### Phase 1:

In the first phase, I was tasked with building a react native app using typescript. I decided to make an app that displays Valorant weapons and their statistics - perfect for someone like me who loves video games, especially Valorant. I used this [**API**](https://valorant-api.com/v1/weapons) to power the app, and it turned out great. It was a fun way to combine my love of technology and gaming.

### Phase 2:

In the next phase, I had to build a similar web app using react js, typescript, and tailwind CSS, and host it on Vercel. I created a sleek and functional web app that showcases Valorant weapons - check it out here: [Valorant Weapons](https://tbb-valorant-weapons-react-app.vercel.app/)**.** It was a great way to showcase my skills and also have some fun with a project that I'm passionate about.

## Video Interview 2

In this final interview, we discussed the feedback from the entire process and I had a chance to ask a few questions of my own. It was a great opportunity to reflect on the experience and learn more about the company. Overall, it was an engaging and informative conversation.
